The cake takes 20 minutes to make the batter, 30 minutes to bake, 2 hours (120 minutes) to cool, and 10 minutes to frost. \n\nFirst, we add the time to make the batter and bake the cake: 20 + 30 = 50 minutes. \n\nThen, we add the time to cool the cake: 50 + 120 = 170 minutes. \n\nFinally, we add the time to frost the cake: 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours.\n\nSo, the total time it takes to make the cake is 3 hours. \n\nIf Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm. 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.\n\nThe final answer is 2:00 pm",
