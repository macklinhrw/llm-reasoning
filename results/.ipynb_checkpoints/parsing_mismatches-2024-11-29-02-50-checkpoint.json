    "text": "Melanie started with 5 vacuum cleaners. She sold 1/3 of them at the green house, which is 5 x 1/3 = 5/3. So she had 5 - 5/3 = 10/3 vacuum cleaners left. She sold 2 more at the red house, so she had 10/3 - 2 = 4/3 vacuum cleaners left. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is 4/3 / 2 = 2/3 vacuum cleaners. So she had 2/3 + 2/3 = 4/3 vacuum cleaners left. Since 4/3 is equal to 1 2/3, Melanie had 1 2/3 vacuum cleaners left. To convert this to a mixed number, we can write 1 2/3 as 1 and 1/3. So Melanie had 1 and 1/3 vacuum cleaners left. The final answer is 1 1/3",

Each of the 3 people sends 2 letters a week, which is 3 x 2 = 6 letters. Each letter is 5 pages long, so 6 letters * 5 pages = 30 pages. Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so 30 pages / 6 pages per minute = 5 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 5 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 1/12 of an hour. The final answer is 1/12",

The total age of the children is 20. So the sum of the ages of the children is 20. 20 - 6.5 = 13.5. Since the average age is 3.25, the sum of the ages of the children is 3.25 x 4 = 13.
