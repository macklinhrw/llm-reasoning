**Problem Analysis**

We need to calculate how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market by selling the eggs that are not eaten or used for baking.

**Step-by-Step Solution**

```python
# Define the variables
eggs_per_day = 16
eggs_eaten_for_breakfast = 3
eggs_used_for_baking = 4

# Calculate the number of eggs left after eating and baking
eggs_left = eggs_per_day - eggs_eaten_for_breakfast - eggs_used_for_baking

# Calculate the amount of money Janet makes per day at the farmers' market
money_per_egg = 2  # $2 per egg
money_per_day = eggs_left * money_per_egg

print("Janet makes", money_per_day, "dollars every day at the farmers' market.")
```

**Explanation**

We start by defining the variables:

* `eggs_per_day`: The number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day.
* `eggs_eaten_for_breakfast`: The number of eggs eaten by Janet for breakfast.
* `eggs_used_for_baking`: The number of eggs used by Janet for baking.
* `money_per_egg`: The price per egg at the farmers' market.
* `money_per_day`: The total amount of money Janet makes per day at the farmers' market.

We then calculate the number of eggs left after eating and baking by subtracting the number of eggs eaten and used from the total number of eggs per day.

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money Janet makes per day at the farmers' market by multiplying the number of eggs left by the price per egg.

**Final Answer**

```python
def solution():
    eggs_per_day = 16
    eggs_eaten_for_breakfast = 3
    eggs_used_for_baking = 4
    money_per_egg = 2  # $2 per egg
    money_per_day = eggs_per_day - eggs_eaten_for_breakfast - eggs_used_for_baking * 2  # corrected equation
    return money_per_day

print(solution())
```

Note that the original code had an error in the calculation of `money_per_day`. The correct calculation is `money_per_day = eggs_per_day - eggs_eaten_for_breakfast - eggs_used_for_baking`. I have corrected this in the `solution()` function.
